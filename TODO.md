# Immediate work to get this tested

- Need to list all sessions on index page
- Need to offer a full text spot in the questions
- Should add a box to the input which is the "goal" and a separate one for the context
- For additional rounds, provide a text box that allows user to guide the questions and any changes to expected output
- Allow user to highlight text and add commentary - incorporate that into questions and next output - call it `feedback`
- Render context in a collapsible section, render as markdown
- Add a set of options for the desired output length - consider expanding to shape in future too - table, list, pros/cons, PRD, etc
- Add a table of contents to the markdown renderer - place on left edge like Less Wrong
- Update README
- Push to github
