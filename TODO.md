# Immediate work to get this tested

- Need to offer a full text spot in the questions
- Should add a box to the input which is the "goal" and a separate one for the context
- For additional rounds, provide a text box that allows user to guide the questions and any changes to expected output
- Allow user to highlight text and add commentary - incorporate that into questions and next output - call it `feedback`
- Allow user to "get more questions" in current round, or "generate output" -- if more questions, add them to the current round alongside other ones -- this expands the current option which is just to get the output

## Working

- Add a set of options for the desired output length - consider expanding to shape in future too - table, list, pros/cons, PRD, etc

## Did not work

- Add a table of contents to the markdown renderer - place on left edge like Less Wrong -- looked too bad, need to rework this if wanted in
